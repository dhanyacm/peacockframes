            <h3 class="text-white font-weight-light mb-4">The Passion Behind the Lens</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Photography, for me, is more than just a hobbyâ€”it's a passion that allows me to freeze moments in time, creating memories that last a lifetime. I've always been fascinated by the art of capturing emotions, expressions, and the beauty that often goes unnoticed in our fast-paced world.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-white font-weight-light mb-4">A Glimpse Into My World</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Hailing from God's Own Country, Kerala, I find inspiration in the lush landscapes, diverse culture, and rich traditions, and these elements often find their way into my work. Whether it's the play of light during the golden hour or the candid laughter of a subject, I strive to convey the essence of each moment in my photographs.</p>

            <h3 class="text-white font-weight-light mb-4">What Drives Me</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">What I love most about photography is its ability to evoke emotions and tell a unique story. Whether it's a candid portrait, a breathtaking landscape, or the details of everyday life, each image holds a narrative waiting to be explored. Through my lens, I aim to share stories that resonate with you, spark curiosity, or simply bring a smile to your face.</p>
